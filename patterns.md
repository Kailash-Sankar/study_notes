### Programming patterns

- Types
  - creational patterns
    - providing object creation mechanisms
  - structural patterns
  - behaviroual patterns
  
- Factory
  - a central function which creates multiple types of objects
  
- Singleton
  - limit the number of instances of an object to one
  
- Strategy
  - encapsualte a set of strategies or function together
  
- Iterator
  - loop over a collection of objects in a certain(custom) order
  
- Observer
  - define one to many relationships (subject to observers)
  - observers watch a subject and wait for an event (event listeners)
  
- Proxy
  - use one object as a placeholder for another
  - control access to an object, instead of using it directly
  
- Mediator
  - define a mediator that encapsulates and controls how some set of objects interact with each other
  
- Visitor
  - add or provide new methods or operations to a an existing object without modfying its source
  - new functionality is kept in a visitor object
  - like extending things

- Command
  - Commands are an object-oriented replacement for callbacks
  - wrap logic as a callable object with actions
  - decoupling
